Welcome to Madison Tech Club
============================

In this repository you will be able to find instructions for the various tools that we use. If your new to the
club this is a great place to start, and if you've been around for a while then consider this reference material in
case you forget how to do something.

Code Editor
-----------

Code is just text, so you can write it in any program that let's you save raw text without any formatting. In other
words, if you are on Windows, Notepad will work, but Word will not. Sometimes you want a more full featured editor.
Something that understands the type of code you are writing and can provide things like coloring of code, suggestions
while you edit, and even checking your code. There are way to many code editors to list all of them here, but below
are a few suggestions that offer a good number of features as well as being available on Windows, OS X, and Linux. I
recommend starting with Sublime Text and then once you are comfortable editing code you can explore some of the other
options.

[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is what we have been using so far.

[Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/) is a fairly new editor that tries to allow you to edit your programs
while they are running.

[Brackets](http://download.brackets.io/) is also a fairly new editor that is mainly intended for working with
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


Web Browser
-----------

Most of the projects we work on use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are all programming tools that run in a web
browser that you can use to build web sites, games, and even mobile applications. Any modern web browser will work.
